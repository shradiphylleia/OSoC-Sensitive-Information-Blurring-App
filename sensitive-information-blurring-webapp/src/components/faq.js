                                            This is a web application that allows you to blur sensitive information in images.
                                            It uses a machine learning model to detect sensitive information in images and blur them.

                                            You can upload an image and select the type of information you want to blur.
                                            The model will detect the information and blur it. You can then download the blurred image.

                                            The blurred image is not stored on our servers either.
